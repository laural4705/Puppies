Daisy’s Second Litter

We had a big night last night! Daisy surprised us by going into labor early 🙂 Her contractions started around 11:30pm. After laboring for a short time, she had her first baby at 12:01 am on 8/10, a yellow female (pink collar).

She gave the first puppy a lot of attention because baby 2 showed up an hour and 10 minutes later at 1:10 am. Baby 2 is a chocolate male.
We did not have to wait long for baby 3, another yellow female, she arrived at 1:30. And baby 4 was right after at 1:37, a black female.

Daisy was really busy cleaning each one and contracting through it all. She was super careful in how she moved her body around the puppies and was very attentive to their newborn noises 🙂

Baby 5 is a black male born at 2:05 and baby 6 a chocolate female who arrived at 2:28. She would end up being the largest pup born weighing in at 1 pound 1 ounce. Baby 7 arrived at 2:45, another chocolate male! And then everything slowed waaay down. 
Daisy was still in labor and contracting, but with no results. I watched over and comforted her while she busied herself with her puppies. 4 hours and many contractions later she gave birth to another chocolate male, unfortunately the journey proved to be too much for him as he was stillborn.

Right after, Daisy had one more puppy, a black female.
So total count 5 male and 4 female. 3 black, 2 yellow and 4 chocolate, 8 survivors. That is a great size litter for Daisy and she seems smitten!

*** Update! - After my nap I went to check on Daisy and she had another chocolate male! So litter of 10, 9 to care for!
